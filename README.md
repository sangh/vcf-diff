This is a small program to basically do a vcf to python (and back again) conversion, so I can diff them in python.  I pretty much use this to back up contacts on an android and be able to flexibly change the format since Google keeps changing the vcf one.  It is in no way a complete vcf syntax reader (at least unless someone wants this and I might be convinced to go through the various versions and make sure it will work).
